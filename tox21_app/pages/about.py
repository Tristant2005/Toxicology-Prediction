    st.write("However, toxicity is a difficult property to quantify, as it depends on the biochemistry and anatomy of the host organism. What is more important to chemists is not only discerning which molecules are toxic, but how they're toxic. For this reason, we define the toxicity of a molecule based off different biological responses of the body, each of which may point to a toxic effect.")

    | NR-AhR | Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor: Receptor in cell cytoplasm that detects Aryl Hydrocarbons. |
    | NR-Aromatase | Aromatase: Enzyme that converts androgens to estrogens. |
    | NR-ER  | Estrogen Receptor: Protein that binds to estrogen. |
    | NR-ER-LBD  | Estrogen Receptor LBD: Binding of estrogenic compounds. |
    | NR-PPAR-gamma  | Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor: Protein that regulates energy storage. |

    st.write("To come up with a list of features for the molecules found in the Tox21 dataset, the CHEMBERT model was used. CHEMBERT is an opensource Chemical Language Transformer. It works by reading SMILES strings (molecular structure encoding) and converts these into useful patterns and features that describe the moleculeâ€™s properties. These features help us train models that can predict whether a molecule might be toxic.")
