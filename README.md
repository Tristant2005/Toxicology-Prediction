# Toxicology-Prediction
A model that uses the tox21 dataset [] attempting to find a realtionship between molecular structure and realtive toxicity.

Currently still an ongoing project. 

What still needs to be completed:
  - Normalize the dataset using SKlearn's standard scalar
  - Change the way the model trains by altering validation splits and sample wieghts

The dataset has already been modified to include molecular descriptors using mordred, however futher testing with other featurisation methods may be beneficial.
