# Toxicology-Prediction
A model that uses the [1] tox21 dataset attempting to find a realtionship between molecular structure and realtive toxicity.

Currently still an ongoing project. 

What still needs to be completed:
  - Normalize the dataset using SKlearn's standard scalar
  - Change the way the model trains by altering validation splits and sample wieghts
